# Web-development-technologies-tdiw

**Web development projects using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, sessions, and asynchronous communication for the TDIW course.**

---

This repository contains the projects and assignments I developed during the *Technologies for Internet and Web Development (TDIW)* course, part of the Computer Engineering program at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB).

The course focuses on building dynamic and secure web applications by combining front-end and back-end technologies. My implementations demonstrate the use of:
- HTML5 and CSS for layout and design
- JavaScript and AJAX for client-side interactivity
- PHP for server-side logic and database communication
- Session management for user tracking and authentication
- MVC design principles
- Secure programming practices (e.g., protection against SQL injection and XSS)

All code is written by me and organized by topic or weekly development milestones. Each folder includes a description or `README.md` with context when relevant.

This repository serves both as a portfolio of my applied learning in web technologies and as a reference for future projects.
